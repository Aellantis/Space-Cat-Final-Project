            <h5 class="text-start">What is this website?</h5>
            <p> Nick and I are back again with a new creation: SpaceCat. ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧ As usual, we incorporated something with cats in our website, while making it somewhat legit by adding design elements that we liked from several airlines such as United and American Airlines. However, instead of making normal commercial travel on an airplane, we decided since there were real companies trying to make space travel possible, to do rocket travel. Hence, CatX by Feline Musk and this website SpaceCat which is a subsidiary.  (≧ヮ≦).</p>
            <h5 class="text-start">Who are the creators of this website?</h5>
            <p> If you missed our last website: The creators are Ashley Yung and Nick Nguyen who both don't own cats, but wish we could have one ( ´•̥̥̥o•̥̥̥`)Once again, unfortunately Nick is allergic, but that doesn't stop him lol. I'm not allergic, but I'd go to a cat cafe too or steal someone elses cat if I could ¯\_(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)_/¯ .</p>
            <h5 class="text-start">Does anything on this site actually work?</h5>
            <p> This time, we tried to make things work/actually make sense. Hence, every link on the home page should direct you SOMEWHERE. The only page in which the flow may not make sense is honestly the flight booking page since we aren’t going to make a payment screen or anything like that. Feel free to click on everything. If there isn't an associated page or feature, it will alert you! ᓚ₍ ^. .^₎</p>
