# UI/UX SPD Course: Space-Cat-Final-Project
## Description:
- For this final project, we were to create a webpage of our choice which could be as legit as we wanted or a joke. I decided that I'd like to create a joke webpage for space travel, so I looked at design choices from various airlines. Then, as always, added cats. In reality, it may become a possibility (the traveling to space part, maybe not sending cats to space before us lol) as I heard in the news/social media or somewhere that people were buying seats to go to space. So I was like, what if it's common like a commercial airline?
